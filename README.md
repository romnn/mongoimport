CLI and go library for importing data from CSV, JSON or XML files into MongoDB.

```bash
go run github.com/romnnn/mongoimport/cmd/mongoimport --db-user=root --db-password=example csv <path-to-csv-files>
```
You can also download pre built binaries from the [releases](https://github.com/romnnn/mongoimport/releases) page.

For a list of options, run
```bash
go run github.com/romnnn/mongoimport/cmd/mongoimport csv --help
```

#### Usage as a library

Using the tool as a standalone CLI tool is great for quick loading of a few files. However, you might need more fine-grained control over what files are imported into which collection or perform additional pre/post processing (e.g. parsing timestamps). For this use case, we offer a very extensivle and modular API for configuring your imports.

```golang
import "github.com/romnnn/mongoimport"

// example t.b.a
```

For more examples, see `examples/`.

#### Development

All commits are automatically built and tested on [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com/romnnn/mongoimport). In order to pass the required checks it is strongly recommended to install the repositories pre commit hooks (assuming you are in the repositories root):
```bash
pip install pre-commit invoke bump2version
pre-commit install
```

The pre commit hooks will run a number of go tools. Try to run `pre-commit run --all-files` and check for missing tools. You might need to install some of those:
```bash
go get -u golang.org/x/lint/golint
go get -u github.com/fzipp/gocyclo
```
In order to be found, make sure to include `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH` (`$GOPATH` has to be set of course like `export GOPATH="$HOME/go` for example).

Before committing, `pre-commit` is run to make sure all checks pass!
